Group project for COMP 380. A software that allows users to see MLB player's stats and pay. We collect data from the MLB (names, positions, salary, stats) and users can search for a particular player and choose to see certain stats or facts about the player. Stats include a player's height, weight, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on base plus slugging, among others. For example, a user can search for "Yasiel Puig" and it will show his stats, team he plays for, his salary, and personal information. The user can also search for certain stats and the software will sort the players by the stats. Another way the user can use the software is by searching for a team and then sort the players by whichever stats they choose.
